# GLM Plus

`GLM Plus` is a Python toolbox for extended Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) beyond the standard offerings. It focuses on practical, statistically grounded methods with clear APIs.

Currently included models: 
- Bayesian quantile regression for ordinal outcomes with J â‰¥ 3 (OR1, translated from the R package bqror) in `glm_plus/ordinal_quantile_regression/ori.py`, and
- Rare events logistic regression (`Relogit`), Firth penalized logistic regression, and zero-inflated count models (`ZIP`, `ZINB`) (work in progress).
